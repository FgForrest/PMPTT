/**
 * Listener interface defines callback methods that would be called in case specific WRITE operation is executed
 * in the {@link one.edee.oss.pmptt.model.Hierarchy}. In case single operation internally translates to multiple node
 * updates several callbacks will occur inside single transaction.
 *
 * Implementation of the listener interface usually execute synchronization logic with data (bounds, order) stored
 * in external systems. This form of de-normalization provides performance gains in database implementations.
 *
 * Raising an exception within listener will stop executed operation and rolls back any changes (depends on the type
 * of {@link one.edee.oss.pmptt.dao.HierarchyStorage} - memory implementation doesn't support rollback process).
 *
 * Extending {@link HierarchyChangeListenerAdapter} is recommended if you need to listen to only single operation.
